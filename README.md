My dotfiles.

## Setup

A makefile is used to create all relevant symlinks and directories. Also
downloads various tools. There are multiple build targets. If you are
running on a system without sudo, do install_remote

```bash
make install_apt # only for systems you have sudo. Installs all packages via apt-get. Much of the functionality in the dotfiles rely on installing these packages

make install # Set everything up on local machine with sudo.

make install_remote # Install without certain features. To be used on remote to prevent compiler and version issues that can not be fixed without sudo.
```

## My tools
